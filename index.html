        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hey there. I am Starnamics. I'm a programmer from New Zealand who has
          over 2 years of experience in Luau, JavaScript and PHP.<br />I also
          have over 1 year of experience in UI Design on the Roblox platform.<br />
          <br />
          I usually spend the day programming things or designing things or
          researching how to do new things, as well as watching YouTube videos
          and talking to people on Discord.<br />
          <br />
          I've worked with many developers throughout my time on Roblox, below
          you can see some of their reviews on me.

        <p>
          Starnamics is one of the most amazing programmers I’ve ever worked
          with. He’s doing an excellent job making Admin Systems and he is
          putting tons of effort into his scripts or UI’s. He has great skill
          and I wouldn’t choose any other programmer or Web Developer to hire.

        <h3>Sonorious:</h3>
        <p>
          Starnamics is an amazing and enthusiastic developer. I work with him
          at Tsunami Sushi. His skill particularly in the field of
          scripting/programming is very efficient and profound. Not only that,
          he is also highly sharp-witted in logic, problem solving and bug
          fixing. Highly recommended for those who are in need of quick and
          professional scripters. Great guy to work with!

          Starnamics is an amazing programmer, he is very skilled at his job and
          puts his hard sweat and tears into everything he does. Working with
          him on Interception and Exodus was a great teachable moment for a new
          developer like me.
